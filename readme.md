Workflows for dealing with training models for well logs.

**train_ns.py** contains information for training a model based on north sea data.
**build_ns_dataset.py** handles feature selection and data split into training and test, re-running the script will result in new datasets.

The Rocklab folder contains some standalone projects developed as idead to include in rocklab eventually.

Utils folder has multiple tools to aid in training, as well as the models themselves. Files are reasonably documented with comments.
